- Steps on how to create GitHub page:
    1. Go to Settings/Pages
    2. Choose a directory to build the page from
    3. Click Save
    4. You may access the website from username.github.io/repositoryName
- Key takeaways:
    - Flexbox is very useful but I feel like too much of it would be reduntant when there are other display types. 
    - Centering an image is still hard.
