                        My name is Kyle Nathaniel P. Vinuya (2022-69573), and I am a sophomore student at UPLB studying Computer Science. When I was young, I was flown to Qatar where I grew up and spent my entire elementary school and high school years. Ever since Grade 11, I began to figure out what course I would take in college. That's when I discovered a course offered by Harvard called CS50, which became my first step in learning programming.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I learned early on that in order to be a good programmer, one must also be adept at dealing with people. So, over the years, I've sought out opportunities to expand my networks and skills. Last summer, I worked a part-time job at KidZania Qatar, which allowed me to interact with people from diverse backgrounds. Currently, I am a resident member of the Young Software Engineers' Society, where I have previously led a project and am now managing an upcoming one.
                    </p>
                        
                    <p>
                        All the effort I put in is geared towards my personal, professional, and academic development.
